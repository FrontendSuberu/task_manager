Okay so today i installed my application and set up my environment And i just learned that a flatlist in react is a component that lets us render our content only when in view.

this widely improves performance and accessibility.

I also learned to have animated splash screen we use lottieflies or jitter.

Also designed the entire app or rather sketched the entire app on my draft book and it turned out great.

Lastly, i also learned good folder structure and how to add custom fonts in our app.

That's all for today till tommorow.

So i had to delete the folder 2x because the packaes were not installed properly and at some point in time i accidently installed a blank application

So after installing the project i notice i had some unnecessary files i needed for this project so i came across a command called "npm run reset-project". which removes all the unnecessary files needed but it did not work so i deleted the parts i did not need for this project.

To have my tasks displayed on the screen i created an array of Objects and used them to display data on my application.

We were told to use the Flatlist component React Native. So in a nutshell a Flatlist is a component that returns output to the user that is within the apps viewport that is to say if we have 100 blocks of data and use the flatlist component it will only display the first 10 depending on your device then as you scroll it shows the other piecies of data.

This imporves performance and an overall nice experience for your users.

The flatlist consists of 3 parameters
Data, KeyExtractor and renderItem

Data - access to our data.
KeyExtractor - used to get the unique id of our data so we can access each object
renderItem - used to return our data on our app

Used SafeAreaView to make our app view to be within the inner section of our application.
I hid the Stack Navigation header so i could have the custom
So i installed expo checkbox so we can use it to check our tasks as completed.

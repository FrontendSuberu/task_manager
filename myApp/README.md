Okay so today i installed my application and set up my environment And i just learned that a flatlist in react is a component that lets us render our content only when in view.

this widely improves performance and accessibility.

I also learned to have animated splash screen we use lottieflies or jitter.

Also designed the entire app or rather sketched the entire app on my draft book and it turned out great.

Lastly, i also learned good folder structure and how to add custom fonts in our app.

That's all for today till tommorow.
